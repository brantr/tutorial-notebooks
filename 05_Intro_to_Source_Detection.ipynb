    "This notebook demonstrates how to run the source detection, measurment, and deblending algorithms with a focus on optimizing for low-surface-brightness object detection. It attempts to split out the source detection and measurement algorithms from `processCCD` and apply them to the search for low-surface-brightness galaxies. Some source detection and measurement details come from [Tune Detection.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertLuptonTheGood/notebooks/blob/master/Demos/Tune%20Detection.ipynb) and [Kron.ipynb](https://github.com/RobertLuptonTheGood/notebooks/blob/master/Demos/Kron.ipynb).\n",
    "Interaction with `lsst.afw.display` was also improved by studying Michael Wood-Vasey's [DC2_Postage Stamps.ipynb](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/DC2-analysis/blob/master/tutorials/dm_butler_postage_stamps.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "After working through this notebook you should be able to\n",
    "   1. Run the `lsst.meas.algorithm` source detection, deblending, and measurement tasks.\n",
    "   2. Plot the resulting source catalogs\n",
    "   3. Examine the `Footprint` of the detected sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Other techniques that are demonstrated, but not empasized, in this notebook are\n",
    "   1. Use the `butler` to access a specific `calexp`.\n",
    "   2. Create an image cutout and use `lsst.afw.display` to plot it.\n",
