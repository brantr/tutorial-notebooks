| | Query the forced source catalog and construct a variable star light curve. |
| | Compare DC2 detections in the Object catalog to the Truth-Match table. |

These tutorials are subject to change, as the Rubin Science Platform and the LSST Science Pipelines are in active development. 

Additional tutorials might be added as the [DP0 Delegates Assemblies](https://dp0-1.lsst.io/dp0-delegate-resources/index.html) series progresses.
